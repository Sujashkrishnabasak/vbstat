    Visva-Bharati represents India where she has her wealth of mind which is for all.
    Visva-Bharati acknowledges India's obligation to offer to others the hospitality
    of her best culture and India's right to accept from others their best.

  content: >
    The Department started in 1999 with its Undergraduate Programmes in
    Statistics both at Major and Minor levels under Siksha-Bhavana (Institute of
    Science). It was augmented with a Post Graduate Programme in 2003 and a
    PhD Programme has also started side by side. It imparts rigorous training
    and exposure to the students in computer education by way of introducing
    the latest state-of-the-art in the programming language and computer
    software to enable the students to perform statistical data analysis. From
    inception, apart from its regular courses, it renders service in
    interdisciplinary research activity. The faculty members have been actively
    engaged in research in both basic and interdisciplinary fields.
