## Siksha-Bhavana

Siksha-Bhavana (Institute of Science) was originally an under-graduate college for teaching Humanities subjects, which during 1961-63 was expanded to include in its curriculum B.Sc.(Hons.) courses in Botany, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Zoology. The M.Sc. programme in Mathematics was introduced in 1963 and the same for other subjects was started in 1968. Finally in 1972, due to reorganisation of the course of studies in the Humanities and Science subjects, all the Science Departments teaching undergraduate and postgraduate courses were brought under Siksha-Bhavana, which is now known as Institute of Science.

Siksha-Bhavana comprises eleven constituents: ten departments (Biotechnology, Botany, Chemistry, Computer & System Sciences, Environmental Studies, Integrated Science Education & Research, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics and Zoology) and one centre (Mathematics Education) where both teaching and research programmes are running leading to award of B.Sc.(Hons.), M.Sc., Integrated M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees. All the departments and centres are doing commendable work with motivation for excellence in developing new courses and in initiating novel fields of research. Six departments â€“ Biotechnology, Botany, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Zoology have received the recognition from the DST, GoI in the form of FIST grants. The departments of Botany, Chemistry and Mathematics have been awarded Special Assistance Programme (DRS) from UGC. Department of Zoology has been awarded Centre for Advanced Study from UGC. The M.Sc. programme of the Department of Biotechnology is supported by the Department of Biotechnology, GoI.

The performance of the students of the Bhavana in the National level tests like, GATE and NET has been very encouraging. A large number of students have qualified in UGC-CSIR NET and GATE examinations. Faculty members of Siksha-Bhavana are carrying out intensive research works in various fields of science.
